        Rohit Sharma was at his fluent best as he hit three sixes in the first three overs of the Indian innings. Rohit and his opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal were not in the mood to spare any of the Bangladesh bowlers as they brought up the fitly in just 3 overs. The urgency was evident as India looked to push for a favourable result even though Day 2 and Day 3 of
         the Test matches were washed out due to a wet outfield and rain in Kanpur.
